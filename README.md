As a big fan of beer. The destiny drop me on Belgium where I had an impressive experience to test a large of different types of beers with such unimaginable testy and aroma. At some point I realized deviation of alcohol percentage significantly affected the testy, I mean after 9% of alcohol the beer with 7% will get testy as water or something bad. So to get a list of the beer that I want to try must go with increase of % alcohol. Another point is not more than 3 beer you feel as different, after you got drunk no matter what you going to drink the testy you will not be remember. When I start realise those factors I know that on 3 beer at one time and alcohol only up. To choose what I will like to drink on this holiday was completely difficult. Maybe I can miss something good I have just 3 beers at night from over 6000 beer what to do? 
I'm decided to grab beer from one specific country, checked on GitHub unfortunately didn't found any grabber with image (if exists) grabber. First impression, to make my choose, I decided to use a picture of the beer and ordered by alcohol %.

Finally I did this Grabber, in a few days. :)
